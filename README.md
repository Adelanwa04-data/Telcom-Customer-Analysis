# Telcom Customer Analysis

## Project Overview

This analysis provides valuable insights into customer behaviors, preferences, and factors influencing retention or churn. By comparing the reports, we can answer key business questions and uncover trends that can inform strategies for improving customer retention.

## Data Sources
---
The primary data source used is Telcom-customer-churn.csv. This open-source data can be freely downloaded from Kaggle or any other open-source data repository site.

## Analytical Tools
---
- Power Query Editor for data cleaning
- Power BI for Data Visualization
- Github for Portfolio Building

## Exploratory Data Analysis
---
- Do customer tenure and age influence churn?
- Are gender and partnership status key factors in churn?
- Does having phone service impact churn?
- Which internet service has the highest churn rate?
- Does contract length impact churn?
- Do additional services impact retention?
- Does the payment method influence churn?
- How does churn impact revenue?

## Summary of Findings
---
- The demographic analysis reveals that customer churn is highest in the **first year**, with **69.98%** of churned customers leaving within this period, indicating potential issues with onboarding and initial service experience. Additionally, senior citizens (25%) and non-partnered individuals (64%) exhibit higher churn rates, suggesting they may face challenges with service usability or affordability. Gender, however, does not significantly impact customer retention, meaning that retention strategies should focus more on tenure and customer needs rather than demographic targeting.  

- Examining services and contract terms, fiber optic users (69%) are more likely to churn compared to DSL users, pointing to possible dissatisfaction with the service quality or pricing. Additionally, having multiple phone lines (50%) does not necessarily improve retention. Contract type is a major churn factor, as monthly contract users (88.6%) have the highest churn rate, while customers with one-year or two-year contracts exhibit much higher retention. Encouraging customers to opt for long-term contracts through incentives or discounts could significantly reduce churn.  

- The impact of additional services and payment methods** on retention is also significant. Customers who subscribe to security, tech support, and device protection services are more likely to stay, whereas those primarily using streaming services exhibit higher churn rates, possibly due to price sensitivity. Additionally, electronic check users are more likely to churn, while customers using bank transfers and credit cards show better retention, suggesting that promoting auto-pay options could improve customer stability.  

- Churn has a direct impact on revenue, with retained customers generating **$16M**, compared to only **$3M from churned customers**. Although the company's **retention rate is 73.5%**, addressing churn factorsâ€”particularly **contract length, service quality, and payment methods** could further increase customer lifetime value and profitability.

## Recommendations
---
- The company should implement stronger onboarding and engagement strategies for new customers. Senior citizens have a higher churn rate. Specialized support, senior-friendly plans, or personalized customer service could help retain them.
- Customers with monthly contracts are more likely to leave. Incentives for long-term contracts should be introduced.
- Fiber optic users have a high churn rate. The company should investigate issues related to service quality, speed, or pricing.
- Customers who use security and support services tend to stay longer. Encouraging more customers to adopt these services may increase retention.
- Electronic check users are more likely to churn. The company should promote automatic payment options to ensure continuous service.
